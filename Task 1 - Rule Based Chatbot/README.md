Task 1 – Rule-Based Chatbot

This project is part of the CODESOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship.

In this task, a simple rule-based chatbot is created using Python.
The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined rules
such as greetings, basic questions, and exit commands.

Concepts Used:
- If-else conditions
- String matching
- Basic conversation flow

This task helped me understand the basics of chatbot logic
and natural language interaction.
